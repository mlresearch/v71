title: Fraud Detection with Density Estimation Trees
year: '2017'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "We consider the problem of anomaly detection in finance. An application
  of interest is the detection of first-time fraud where new classes of fraud need
  to be detected using unsupervised learning to augment the existing supervised learning
  techniques that capture known classes of frauds. This domain usually has the following
  requirements - (i) the ability to handle data containing both numerical and categorical
  features, (ii) very low latency real-time detection, and (iii) interpretability.
  We propose the use of a variant of density estimation trees (DETs) (Ram and Gray,
  2011) for anomaly detection using distributional properties of the data. We formally
  present a procedure for handling data sets with both categorical and numerical features
  while Ram and Gray (2011) focused mainly on data sets with all numerical features.
  DETs have demonstrably fast prediction times, orders of magnitude faster than other
  density estimators like kernel density estimators. The estimation of the density
  and the anomalousness score for any new item can be done very efficiently. Beyond
  the flexibility and effciency, DETs are also quite interpretable. For the task of
  anomaly detection, DETs can generate a set of decision rules that lead to high anomalousness
  scores. We empirically demonstrate these capabilities on a publicly available fraud
  data set."
