abstract: "Credit card fraud detection is an endless war between fraudsters and payment
  service providers. Indeed, annual global \ffinancial loss by credit card frauds
  has increased. Fraudsters have been organized and systematized, attempting to \fnd
  weak points of existing fraud detection system (FDS). State-of-the-art FDS approaches
  utilize already existing fraud cases, which can result in di\verent FDS by payment
  service providers. Therefore, a new payment service provider may not have room for
  installing a FDS due to the lack of fraudulent cases. Moreover, credit card transactions
  contain the legitimate owner’s personal information, which can be exposed to an
  honest but curious fraud analyst. In this paper, we propose a purchase density based
  FDS (PD-FDS) that uses three features which are not related to personal information.
  PD-FDS does not require already existing fraudulent transactions and also shows
  low false positive rate (<0.01)."
