abstract: "Currently, unknown unknowns in high dimensional big data environments can
  go unnoticed for a long period of time. The failure to detect anomalies in critical
  infrastructure data can result in extensive financial, operational, reputational
  and life threatening consequences. In this paper, we describe algorithms for an
  automatic and unsupervised anomaly detection that do not necessitate domain expertise,
  signatures, rules, patterns or semantics understanding of the features. We propose
  several new methodologies for anomaly detection to protect critical infrastructures,
  with emphasis on finance, spanning from theory to actionable technology. Although
  anomalies can originate from several sources, we also show that cyber threat, financial
  and operational malfunction are converging into a single detection paradigm. Performance
  comparison between different algorithms (ours and others) is presented as well as
  examples from real use cases."
