title: Ensemble-Based Anomaly Detetction using Cooperative Learning
year: '2017'
section: Contributed Talks
abstract: Using the same process and functionality to solve both clustering and outlier
  discovery is highly desired. Such integration will be of great benefit to discover
  outliers in data and consequently obtain better clustering results after eliminating
  the set of outliers. It is known that the capability of discovering outliers using
  clustering-based techniques is mainly based on the quality of the adopted clustering.
  In this paper, a novel Cooperative Clustering Outlier Detection (CCOD) algorithm
  is presented. It involves multiple clustering techniques; the goal of the cooperative
  approach is to discover those outliers that are not detected by the single clustering-based
  outlier detection approaches using the methodology of cooperation. Undertaken experimental
  results show that the detection accuracy of the cooperative technique is better
  than that of the typical clustering-based FindCBLOF method over a number of artificial,
  gene expression and text document datasets.
