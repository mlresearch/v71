abstract: "Financial services and technology companies invest significantly in monitoring
  their complex technology infrastructures to allow for quick responses to technology
  failures. Because of the volume and velocity of signals monitored (e.g., customer
  transaction volume, API calls, server CPU utilization, etc.), they require sophisticated
  models of normal system behavior to determine when a component falls into an anomalous
  state. Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, Bayesian nonparametric models that
  have successfully been used for time series forecasting, interpolation, and anomaly
  detection in complex data sets. Despite the growing use of GPs for time series analysis
  in the literature, these methods scale poorly with the size of the data. In particular,
  data sets containing multiple timescales can pose a problem for GPs, as they can
  require a large number of points for training. We describe a novel method for including
  long and short timescale information without including an impractical number of
  data points through the use of a binned process, defined as the definite integral
  over a latent Gaussian process. This results in a binned covariance function for
  the time series, which we use to \ft and forecast data at multiple resolutions.
  The resulting models achieve higher accuracy with fewer data points than their non-binned
  counterparts, and are more robust to long tailed noise, heteroskedasticity, and
  data artifacts."
