abstract: "Business transactions between customers and financing entities are often
  governed by intermediary agents. In this scenario, actions taken by these agents
  can a\vect the likelihood of adverse outcomes for both the customers and the\ffinancial
  institution. Our goal is to establish a general framework that identi\fes these
  types of anomalous agents. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel application of
  anomaly detection using isolation forests to identify which agents may be associated
  with adverse outcomes. We apply a genetic algorithm to understand which features
  were key to the performance of anomaly detection and and suggest a general framework
  for problems that similarly concern the behaviors of third-party agents."
