title: Collective Fraud Detection Capturing Inter-Transaction Dependency
year: '2017'
section: Contributed Talks
abstract: "In e-commerce, different payment transactions have different levels of
  risk. Risk is generally higher for digital goods, but it also differs based on product
  and its popularity, the offer type (packaged game, virtual currency to a game or
  subscription service), storefront and geography. Existing fraud policies and models
  make decisions independently for each transaction based on transaction attributes,
  payment velocities, user characteristics, and other relevant information. However,
  suspicious transactions may still evade detection and hence we propose a novel approach
  leveraging a graph based perspective to uncover relationships among suspicious transactions,
  i.e., inter-transaction dependency. Our focus is to detect suspicious transactions
  by capturing common fraudulent behaviors that would not be considered suspicious
  when being considered in isolation. In this paper, we present HitFraud that leverages
  heterogeneous information networks for collective fraud detection by exploring correlated
  and fast evolving fraudulent behaviors. First, a heterogeneous information network
  is designed to link entities of interest in the transaction database via different
  semantics. Then, graph based features are efficiently discovered from the network
  exploiting the concept of meta-paths, and decisions on frauds are made collectively
  on test instances. Experiments on real-world payment transaction data from Electronic
  Arts demonstrate that the prediction performance is e\vectively boosted by HitFraud
  where the computation of meta-path based features is largely optimized. Notably,
  recall can be improved up to 7.93% and F-score 4.62% compared to baselines."
